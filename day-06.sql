-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL

-- My Solution:

WITH AnnualSnowfall AS (
  SELECT
    resort_name,
    SUM(snowfall_inches) AS total_snowfall
  FROM
    resort_monthly_snowfall
  GROUP BY
    resort_name
)
SELECT
  resort_name,
  total_snowfall,
  NTIlE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_snowfall DESC) AS snowfall_qartile
FROM
  AnnualSnowfall;
